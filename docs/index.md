Overview
========

[FRI]{.title-ref} is a Python 3 package for analytical feature selection
purposes. It allows superior feature selection in the sense that all
important features are conserved. At the moment we support multiple
linear models for solving Classification, Regression and Ordinal
Regression Problems. We also support LUPI paradigm where at learning
time, privileged information is available.
